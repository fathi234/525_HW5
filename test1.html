     <p style="font-size:160%;"><i>"Coffee Plantations" are one of the best things witnessed in my trip.While talking about Coorg, coffee deserves the first mention. Besides visiting a coffee plantation, we could first hand see the various stages that coffee seeds go through before getting into our cuppa. Carpets of coffee seeds laid to sun dry outside the houses is a common sight in Coorg.It was quite pleasant to watch the view and i also bought some pure coffee beans for me and family.</i></p>
